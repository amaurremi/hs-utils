   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   1  Implement a `wc' that interprets the options presented by the option
      parser.


   2  Fix the option parsing library so that it throws errors when bad options
      (`--lnes') are entered. It should error out on any string beginning with
      with `--' that is not an option; it should also error out on any two
      character sequence beginning with `-' that is not an option. In the
      application, we should present diagnostics and quit when there are
      parsing errors.


   3  Our `(Set Option, [String])' representation of options and arguments
      does not work for the `--files0-from=F' option of GNU `wc'. Adjust the
      parser, the underlying data structure and the application to support
      this option.


   4  To support the `--chars' and `--bytes' options is difficult; we must
      have some knowledge of text-encoding. Should we switch to ByteString and
      introduce a new counter that has some knowledge of the character
      encoding?  You have some flexibility; it's nice if you can support both
      byte and character counting in any encoding GHC understands; it's also
      nice if it can handle UTF-8 (the most common encoding by far) with high
      performance.
